Renewable Energy Management System
This is a web application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB that provides a centralized platform for managing renewable energy data, tracking assets, setting objectives, and automating processes for building and maintaining renewable energy plants.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install Node.js and MongoDB on your machine if you haven't already.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run npm install to install all the dependencies.
Create a .env file and set the required environment variables (see .env.example for reference).
Run npm start to start the server.
Features
This web application includes the following features:

User authentication and authorization using JWT
CRUD operations for managing Users, Assets, EnergyData, Objectives, and PowerPlants
Data visualization using Chart.js
Integration with MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database storage
Automated testing using Jest and Supertest
API Routes
Here are the available API routes for this application:

Users
POST /api/users/signup: Create a new user account
POST /api/users/login: Log in to an existing user account
GET /api/users/:id: Get user information by ID
PUT /api/users/:id: Update user information by ID
DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete user by ID
Assets
POST /api/assets: Create a new asset
GET /api/assets/:id: Get asset information by ID
PUT /api/assets/:id: Update asset information by ID
DELETE /api/assets/:id: Delete asset by ID
EnergyData
POST /api/energydata: Create a new energy data entry
GET /api/energydata/:id: Get energy data by ID
PUT /api/energydata/:id: Update energy data by ID
DELETE /api/energydata/:id: Delete energy data by ID
Objectives
POST /api/objectives: Create a new objective
GET /api/objectives/:id: Get objective by ID
PUT /api/objectives/:id: Update objective by ID
DELETE /api/objectives/:id: Delete objective by ID
PowerPlants
POST /api/powerplants: Create a new power plant
GET /api/powerplants/:id: Get power plant information by ID
PUT /api/powerplants/:id: Update power plant information by ID
DELETE /api/powerplants/:id: Delete power plant by ID
Data Visualization
To view a visualization of the energy data stored in the database, you can send a GET request to the /api/energydata/visualize route. This will trigger the processDataForVisualization function in the energydata.controller.js file, which will prepare the data for visualization using Chart.js. The resulting chart image will be returned as a response.

Testing
To run the automated tests for this application, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
This will run the Jest test suite and generate a coverage report.

Conclusion
This is a basic implementation of a renewable energy management system that can be used to track and manage renewable energy assets, monitor energy production, and set objectives for the renewable energy sector. With further development, this application could be expanded to include more advanced features such as predictive maintenance, weather forecasting, and machine learning-based
